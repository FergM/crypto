# Crypto
Notes and code.

# Use Cases
### Stable Coin
##### Hyper-Inflation
Stablecoins can help people sell their inflationary currency before it depreciates. There's real depegging risk though if people keep large sums in stablecoins. 

I'd be interested to learn more about how stablecoins compare to just buying foreign fiat, and why/whether there are less restrictions applied to stablecoins.

##### Remittances
This is probably a broader category of using crypto to bypass the fees in bank based systems. There's possibly other benefits such as using currency in regions without a reliable banking system.

I've been thinking about money at risk for users of these systems. One option is to feed small amounts of money at a time. But the success of that depends on fee structures and an ability to convert out of crypto on the other end. 

Interestingly with remittances, even if people can't convert their local currency into stablecoin because of restrictions, they might still be able to receive stablecoins as remittances from abroad. Once received the stablecoins might hold some value locally for trade.

##### Dollar Depegging
At the moment the USD is a good global price benchmark. On the scale of months most things people want to buy are stable in USD terms. But what if we can bypass the USD and make a currency more directly fixed to the things people want to buy?

Historically the currencies I can think of started out pegged to something else. For example Gold, USD or GBP. So I think that any crypto-currency that behaves like a good currency will most likely start out pegged to a fiat currency.

### Non-Stable Coins
##### Equity
The idea here is to sell coins as a form of equity. As such they would be non-stable It offers one more possibility for raising funds.

Crowd Funding:
* Initial coin offerings are sort of crowd funding
* People buy the cryptographic right to future profits, or such.

Initial Public Offering:
* Initial Coin Offerings can be cheaper and less bureaucratic to implement than formal IPOs.
