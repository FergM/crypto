# Other Notes
* [notebooks/](./notebooks/) is where I analyse things
    * e.g. [Daily Volatility of BTC and ETH](./notebooks/NB01%20Returns%20-%20BTC%20ETH%20-%20Daily.ipynb)

##### Fergalâ€™s rule of Crypto:
What:
```
When doing something with crypto ask yourself whether it could work better without crypto.
```
* The same applies for Machine Learning...
* Choose a simpler solution as a benchmark
* Apply a cost function to model complexity

Why:
* Helps you to spot the simpler solution if it exists
* Helps you to undertand *why* you are using crypto if you still want to use it
