# Crypto Valuation
Lets use Bitcoin as an example. **Why does Bitcoin have value**?

First lets think about different **ways for something to have value**.
* Future earnings
    *  e.g. Dividends. Dividends contribute to the value of a Stock
* Ownership of assets
    *  e.g. Cash. Stock in such companies is valuable because shareholders could close the company and pay themselves the cash.
* Utility
    * e.g. Gold. Usefulness contributes to the value of gold. It is malleable and it conducts. 
    * You could even argue that gold jewellery provides utility.
    * Similarly the demand for Bitcoin from technology enthusiasts can be viewed as utility.
    * All sources of value really come down to utility either directly or indirectly.
    * Advantages over Fiat Currency
        * Crypto can be useful if it has advantages over fiat currency
        * e.g. reduced transaction costs, anonymity
        * See [here](./use_cases.md) for my thoughts on Crypto Use Cases

Lets extend the above notes and thing about "**price supports**". These are mostly variations on the utility point above. In particular, "price supports" can be helpful in stabalising the value of an asset.
* Taxes
    * If governments **denominate** taxes and fines in Bitcoin then this can act as a demand and price support.
    * If bitcoin becomes too cheap than people can arbitrage and pay their taxes in bitcoin rather than fiat.
    * This point is more poignant for fixed nominal taxes and utility bills rather than percentage taxes such as income tax.
    * It's important to make a distinction between denominating in Bitcoin and accepting Bitcoin based on nominal fiat currency amounts.
* Contracts
    * If businesses start writing contracts in bitcoin.
    * This is similar to the taxes argument and can add similar stabilising pressures
    * To get this benefit Bitcoin would need to "convince" people that it's more useful in some way than fiat currency
* Anticipated Future Utility
    * Even if bitcoin is not super useful right now, the anticipation that it might be useful in the future can help support its price.

Now lets consider the **Speculation Bubble** aspect:
* Speculation can support the price of something which doesn't really have any value.
* e.g. Pyramid Schemes. Pyramid/Ponzi schemes where new entrants fund the profits of early adopters
* If there's no inherent usefulness then people are only participating because they hope they can flip Bitcoin to someone else for a profit. Such an arrangement will almost surely run out of steam eventually.
* Rough reasoning:
    * The price only goes up if the volume of demand increases
    * At some point things run out of new participants and or exhaust the demand of existing participants
    * If the participation level is low a bubble can perhaps be maintained for a long time through churn (new people enter, old people leave). Even then it will lack the stability provided by price supports and usefulness.

### Stablecoins & Depegging
On the topic, I think Stablecoin projects could benefit from **Black Start** contingency plans.

Outline:
* Suppose some stable coin is useful for frictionless small transactions (like buying coffee)
* Then one day the coin depegs (no biggie, hopefully people only had small holdings in it)
* Why not have a plan to "Black Start" just like electricity grids do?

Why is this interesting:
* Stablecoins have an inherent depegging risk.
* In contrast with Bitcoin which looks volatile to begin with, a stable coin could look stable for many days but then crash to near zero one day.
